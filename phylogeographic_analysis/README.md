# Phylogeographic analyses

- **Step 1:** Phylogeographic analysis with all covariates included
- **Step 2:** Phylogeographic analysis with only air traffic between regions included

## Note
Before running the XML files a file of empirical posterior trees needs to be obtained and the filenames of the empirical tree files in the XML files may need to be modified. Such an empirical tree file can be obtained from the analyses inside `phylogenetic_analyses/` folder.
