# Regression analysis

Analysis below examines the relationship between antigenic drift, air traffic (defined as the converse of the rescaled flight passenger arrivals), and influenza dwell time (also referred as to persistence time) in the context of pre-pandemic, acute and transition phase of the pandemic, and post-pandemic period across twelve world regions. Here, we are only focusing on the analyses for Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia, since the estimates of dwell time over there are much more reliable due to the greater number of sequences available during the pandemic period. Previous literature (Bedford et al., 2015) has observed effects of antigenic drift on persistence given seasonality on influenza. Present analyses attempt to explore whether the dwell time was affected by the COVID-19 pandemic's restrictions (i.e. lower amongst-region human movement), alongside antigenic drift, at a global scale via a causal Bayesian model.
